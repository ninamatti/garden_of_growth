# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and created during my time at 
Code Chrysalis.

## Getting Started

This App is still in the early development stages, but if you want to have a look, you can check it out at:






## Features at a Glance

### Planting a new Flower

> You can find detailed documentation about drawing [here][drawing-docs].

The most basic operation *Zircon* supports is `draw`ing. You can draw individual `Tile`s or `TileGraphics` objects on your `TileGrid`. a `TileGraphics` object is composed of `Tile`s. This is a powerful tool and you can implement more complex features using simple `draw` operations. In fact the component system is implemented on top of drawing, layering and input handling features.

## Road Map

Here are some features which are either under way or planned:


- [ ] [Floating Components](https://github.com/Hexworks/zircon/issues/23)


If you'd like to give any of these a shot feel free to *contribute*.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
