## Motivation

I love the idea of gamification to motivate Users to do tasks that benefit them, but are hard to get around to. Using a flower-planting mechanism has the goal to give a user a digital reward for completing a hard or annoying task. I plan to insert this mechanic into a skill tracker app in the future.

## Deployment

This App is still in the early development stages, but if you want to have a look, you can check it out at:
