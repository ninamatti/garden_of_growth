## Features at a Glance

### Planting a new Flower

> You can find detailed documentation about drawing [here][drawing-docs].

The most basic operation *Zircon* supports is `draw`ing. You can draw individual `Tile`s or `TileGraphics` objects on your `TileGrid`. a `TileGraphics` object is composed of `Tile`s. This is a powerful tool and you can implement more complex features using simple `draw` operations. In fact the component system is implemented on top of drawing, layering and input handling features.
